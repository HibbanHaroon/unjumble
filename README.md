# Unjumble
[Unjumble](https://unjumble.onrender.com/) is a word puzzle game that challenges you to unscramble words with hints. Test your word-solving skills, expand your vocabulary, and enjoy endless brain-teasing fun!

A jumbled word is displayed on the screen with a hint. You have to decipher the word and check it if you got it correct :)
### Design Inspiration

I am really crazy about websites with brutalist designs. So I decided to make one myself. I took some design inspirations from [this site](https://www.brutalistwebsites.com/).

Explore! Have fun ðŸ˜‰
### Implementation

In order to get the word and the hint, I decided to use gpt-3.5-turbo model from OpenAI. It's just a simple Node.js API deployed on render as a web service... Nothing too fancy. 

Do checkout [word-generation](https://github.com/HibbanHaroon/unjumble/tree/word-generation) branch if you're interested.
